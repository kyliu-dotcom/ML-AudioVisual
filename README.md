# 🎧 ML Audio Emotion Visualizer

A machine learning–based project built in Google Colab that analyzes audio and generates visual representations driven by predicted emotional state (mood). The project combines audio feature processing, a trained CNN model, and a mood mapping system to transform sound into emotion-based visual outputs.

Developed with Claire Kim, Daniel Chen, Nathaniel Scanlon, and Sohum Walavalkar as part of final project for Art and Machine Learning course at CMU

## 🧠 Overview

This project explores the relationship between audio signals and emotion by:
- Extracting audio features from input sound
- Using a trained CNN model to predict emotional state
- Mapping predictions through a custom mood table system
- Generating visual outputs based on predicted mood

The entire workflow was developed and executed in **Google Colab notebooks**.
